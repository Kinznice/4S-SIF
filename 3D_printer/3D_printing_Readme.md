**3D Printed structure** <br />

V1 = 2018 year version. We measured 755, 760, 770 nm seperately by using three photodiodes. <br /> <br />
V2 = 2019 year version. We changed overall structure to remove light leakage. <br /> <br />
V3 = 2020 year version. We changed PCB to reduce dark current fluctuation. <br /> <br />
Final V = 2021 year version. We tried to meausre 755, 760, 770 nm using one photodiode. <br /> <br />
